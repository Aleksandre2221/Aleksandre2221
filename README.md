## Hi there 👋
#### I'm Alex, 23 years old, and a self-taught Data Analyst. I love learning by doing, and I’ve built a few projects that showcase my skills and passion for data.


####     ℹ️ Here are a few things that define me:

• ✅ **Discipline & Consistency:** I keep a steady learning and problem-solving streak, which you can see here on GitHub or my on <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/1PdeKXvscm/">LeetCode</a> profile. 


• 🛠️ **Skills:** I have hands-on experience with Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/Aleksandre2221/DA_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/README.md">Portfolio Projects</a> to see them in action.   


• 🔥 **Passion:** I enjoy analyzing data and building projects that solve real problems. My GitHub profile reflects this dedication.


  Feel free to explore my work and connect with me! 🚀
