# Hi there 👋
#### I'm Alex, 23 years old, and a self-taught Data Analyst. I love learning by doing, and I’ve built a few projects that showcase my skills and passion for data.

#### Here are a few things that define me:
1. ✅ **Discipline & Consistency:** I keep a steady learning and problem-solving streak, which you can see on my GitHub and LeetCode.  
2. 🛠️ **Skills:** I have hands-on experience with Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools. Check out my portfolio projects to see them in action.  
3. 🔥 **Passion:** I enjoy analyzing data and building projects that solve real problems. My GitHub profile reflects this dedication.

Feel free to explore my work and connect with me! 🚀
